## ROADMAP

- [ ] ultimately, it would be nice to npm install, then require as a dependency to use.
- [ ] get all of those dependencies out of the root project's `package.json`
- [ ] modularize all the pieces of the gulp file. 
- [ ] gulp-caddy.config file to alter options from the root of the project
